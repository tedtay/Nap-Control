# Nap Control: A Novel System For Precisely Controlling Nap Duration
### Project Abstract

Lack of sleep costs the UK economy £40 billion per year . However, this is unsurprising considering
that over third of UK adults struggle to get to sleep at least once a week and of this group 46% say that
their poor sleep ‘severely’ or ‘very severely’ impacts their focus levels at work.

This dissertation details the planning and development of a prototype device that is able to combat the UK’s, along with other countries’, issues resulting from a lack of sleep amongst their populations.

The device created encourages napping through providing more control and certainty to users
over their nap duration and therefore helps to mitigate the impact of a lack of sleep.
