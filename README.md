# Nap Control: A Novel System For Precisely Controlling Nap Duration
###### Please contact @tedtay for permission to reference or use any of the work/ code in this repository 
### Project Abstract

Lack of sleep costs the UK economy £40 billion per year . However, this is unsurprising considering
that over third of UK adults struggle to get to sleep at least once a week and of this group 46% say that
their poor sleep ‘severely’ or ‘very severely’ impacts their focus levels at work.

This dissertation details the planning and development of a prototype device that is able to combat the UK’s, along with other countries’, issues resulting from a lack of sleep amongst their populations.

The device created encourages napping through providing more control and certainty to users
over their nap duration and therefore helps to mitigate the impact of a lack of sleep.

### Methodology
This project has successfully developed a proof-of-concept system that uses electroencephalogram
(EEG) brain data to determine when a subject has fallen asleep and allow an alarm to be set from
that moment. 

This system was implemented in two stages: hardware development and software
development. The hardware functions as a sensor and relay, meaning it collects the brain wave data and
then sends it to the software. The software acts as the brains of the operation – processing the raw data
to determine when the user has fallen asleep.

### Prerequisites

Initial hardware setup and Arduino configuration was followed from the @kitschpatrol BrainGrapher repo. I thank @kitschpatrol for allowing me to use his method in this project.
